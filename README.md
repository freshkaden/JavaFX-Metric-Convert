# Assignment 13 JavaFX-Metric-Convert
This program elaborates on previous Assignment 5 where a simple CLI program was built to convert some common
metric measurements to imperial measurements. This program does the same thing, except instead of CLI it is
now GUI by implementing JavaFX graphics into the program.

User can input desired numerical input value into the text box.
User can then choose from a list of conversion options in a drop down choice box.
The conversion is then calculated and outputted to the user all contained within the window box.
